## setup

save old things:

```
mv ~/.vim ~/.vim.old
mv ~/.vimrc ~/.vimrc.old
```

clone:

```
git clone https://github.com/niartenyaw/vim.git ~/.vim
```

create link vimrc:

```
ln ~/.vimrc ~/.vim/vimrc
```

this started as a copy of [amix/vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc) but has been customized to fit my own preferences.
